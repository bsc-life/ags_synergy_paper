# Model Directory

This directory contains the PhysiBoSS model files for AGS gastric adenocarcinoma simulations.

## What This Contains

The essential PhysiBoSS model components needed to run the multiscale agent-based simulations described in our manuscript, including:

- Boolean network definitions for AGS signaling pathways
- Agent-based model configurations
- Drug pharmacodynamic parameters
- Simulation setup files

## Prerequisites

PhysiBoSS v2.2.0 must be installed to use these model files.

## Status

This README will be expanded with detailed usage instructions, parameter descriptions, and complete documentation as the repository develops.

*For now, this directory contains the core model files. Detailed documentation and tutorials will be added here.*
